# LLM Integration (Local)
langchain-ollama
ollama # Ensure Ollama server is installed and running separately

# PDF Parsing
pymupdf # For basic text/image extraction
unstructured # Powerful parsing, might need extra dependencies like 'local-inference'
# python-poppler # Often needed by unstructured

# Text Processing & Analysis
nltk # For sentence tokenization, etc. (download data needed)
spacy # For NER (download models needed)
# transformers # For potential local models (captioning, NER)
# sentence-transformers # For semantic chunking/embeddings

# Image Processing (Optional - requires specific libraries)
# pillow # Basic image handling
# pytesseract # For OCR (requires Tesseract installation)

# Utilities
python-dotenv # For managing environment variables (like Ollama base URL)
ipykernel # For running Jupyter notebooks
jupyter # For running Jupyter notebooks

# Add other specific libraries as needed for agents
pandas

# Graph Visualization
# brew install graphviz # Requires Graphviz system library to be installed
