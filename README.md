# Multi-agent system for getting PDF data ready for RAG.

**1. Main Goal:**
Build an automatic system that uses many special agents to read, understand, pull out, clean up, study, and organize difficult information from PDF documents. This system will create meaningful and connected pieces of data (called "chunks"). These chunks will also have important extra information (metadata). They will be ready to put into a special database (vector store) to help with search systems (like Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG).

**2. What Goes In:**
PDF documents. These files might have different kinds of content mixed together (like text, tables, pictures, charts) and complicated layouts (like multiple columns, headers/footers, etc.).

**3. What Comes Out:**
A JSON file that contains a list of data chunks. Each chunk includes:
    * The processed content (text, descriptions of images/charts, organized tables).
    * Related extra information (like the original page number, type of content, identified names or things, how it relates to other chunks, language, etc.).
    * *(First stage: Output will be a JSON file to make it easy to check for errors. Later stage: Directly save the chunks into the vector store).*

**4. Suggested Structure:**
A flexible process (pipeline) that can manage different tasks, allowing some tasks to run at the same time to make things faster. The system includes these special agents:

**5. Proposed Agents and How They Work:**

* **Agent 0: Layout Analysis Agent (Optional):**
    * *Job:* Looks at the overall structure of the PDF page (columns, sections, logical reading order) before pulling out the details.
    * *Output:* Information about the layout for the next agents.

* **Agent 1: Document Parser Agent:**
    * *Job:* Uses strong tools (like `PyMuPDF`, `unstructured.io`, `Marker`) and might use information from Agent 0. Pulls out the basic parts: text blocks, images, tables, charts. Gets basic extra information about the document (file name, page number).
    * *(Improvement):* Could add a special **Metadata Agent** to find and organize more detailed extra information (author, title, creation date, etc.).
    * *Output:* Raw pieces of data sorted by type.

* **Agent 1.5: Language Detection Agent (Conditional):**
    * *Job:* Figures out the language of each text block (if the document uses multiple languages).
    * *Output:* Text blocks with language information attached.

* **Agent 2: Text Cleaning & Enhancement Agent:**
    * *Job:* Takes the raw text blocks. Removes unwanted things (like extra line breaks, headers/footers, page numbers). Rearranges the text into clear sentences and paragraphs.
    * *(Improvement):* Could add abilities to **Recognize Named Entities (NER)** and **Handle Acronyms** to make the text more meaningful.
    * *Output:* Clean, structured text that has more meaning.

* **Agent 3: Image Analysis Agent:**
    * *Job:* Takes image data. Creates a text description for the image (image captioning). If the image has text, it reads the text (OCR), cleans it, and provides the text content.
    * *Output:* Text description or text content from the image.

* **Agent 4: Chart Analysis Agent:**
    * *Job:* Takes chart data (as images). Figures out the type of chart, the data in it, and creates a summary or explanation in text.
    * *Output:* Description or explanation of the chart's content.

* **Agent 5: Table Analysis Agent:**
    * *Job:* Takes table data. Analyzes the structure and content.
    * *Output:* The table shown in a standard format (like JSON or Markdown) or described in simple language that AI models (LLMs) can easily understand.

* **Agent 6: Information Synthesis & Ordering Agent:**
    * *Job:* Takes the processed results from Agents 2, 3, 4, and 5. Uses the original reading order (from Agent 0/1) to put the content back together in a connected and logical flow.
    * *(Improvement):* Could add a **Relationship Extraction Agent** to find and note links between different pieces of content (like text referring to a table or image).
    * *Output:* All the document content, processed and arranged in the correct logical order, possibly with relationship information.

* **Agent 7: Semantic Chunking Agent:**
    * *Job:* Takes all the combined content. Uses smart ways (based on structure, topic, or meaning) to divide the document into meaningful pieces (chunks), making sure they keep their context. Offers choices for how to do the chunking.
    * *Output:* A list of meaningful data chunks.

* **Agent 8: Quality Check & Output Formatting Agent:**
    * *Job:* Does a final check on the quality and flow of the chunks. Formats all the information (chunk content + extra information) into the defined standard JSON structure.
    * *Output:* The final, complete JSON file.

* **Orchestrator:**
    * *Role:* Manages the workflow, sends data to the correct agents, handles dependencies, and can allow independent agents (like 2, 3, 4, 5) to run at the same time to speed things up.

**6. Core Principles:**
Highly modular (parts can be swapped easily), flexible, focused on deep understanding of meaning, uses existing tools, and can be continuously improved.
